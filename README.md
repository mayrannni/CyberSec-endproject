### 3. Installation
1. Clone this repository  
   -> git clone https://github.com/mayrannni/CyberSec-endproject.git  
   -> cd CyberSec-endproject  
3. Preferably have PowerShell, BASH and Python installed. '''However, we consider problems depending on the different operating systems'''.

### 4. Usage
To launch the main menu with Python  
-> python main_menu.py  
The main menu allows you to select and run any of the cybersecurity scripts. Each script corresponds to specific security tasks such as scanning, security API's query or analyzing system information.

### 5. More about scripts
#### PowerShell
  - **Hash-based API query**  
    *Request-ApiHashBased.ps1* requests a Virus Total API based on file hashes.
  - **Hidden files review**  
    *Show-HiddenFiles.ps1* displays a list of hidden files.
  - **Computer resources usage display**  
    *Get-PCInformation.ps1* checks detailed information about the use of computer resources.
  - **Information about last logins**  
    *Show-LogsLogin.ps1* checks if logins on a device were successful.
#### GNU Bash
  - **SSH Honeypot**  
    *ssh_honeypot.sh* uses netcat and netstat to listen for connections and filter them.
  - **Scanning ports and vulnerabilities**  
    *scanning.sh* uses nmap for port and vulnerability scanning. 
#### Python
  - **Scan vulnerabilities for websites**  
    *web_scanning.py* uses [ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/download/) and [ZAP API](https://pypi.org/project/zaproxy/) to scanning vulnerabilities from websites. 
  - **Check open ports - SHODAN**  
    *open_ports.py* uses Shodan API to scan an IP and returns the open ports of that IP. 
  - **Use IP Abuse Database**  
    *ip_inspector.py* uses IP Abuse Database API and checks how reliable and trusted is the given IP.
  - **Scanning IP addreses - NMAP**  
    *ip_scanning.py* uses nmap to scan the most common vulnerabilities for a given IP address.
  - **Reporting IP addresses**  
    *report_ip.py* uses IP Abuse Database API to report the compromised IP that nmap (based on *ip_scanning.py*) returns with vulnerabilities.
